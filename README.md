Question: Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.


In the assignment project, state management was achieved using React's built-in state management capabilities, primarily through the use of React Hooks such as useState and useEffect. These hooks allowed us to create and update component-level state variables, ensuring dynamic data handling and rendering as users interacted with the website. Additionally, state was efficiently managed in a centralized manner for global features using context providers and reducers, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience across the entire application.
